# Zomato_Customer_Analysis_on_Tableau
The objective was to explore customer demographics to pinpoint viable marketing strategies and understand consumer behavior for a fictional restaurant and food delivery company called Zomato. The basis for this analysis would allow for dashboard development and continued evaluation of business decisions and their effect on consumer behavior.

The analysis revealed the majority identification of the consumers, purchasing trends, and recommendations for future marketing strategies on both customer retention and increasing the customer pool. Between the Order Frequency & Active User data across days, weeks, and months, we are looking at a downward trend in expected sales going into Q3 2020. The Average Spend per Customer compared to different years shows that 2020 is not looking as strong in its initial month as it did during previous years as customers are tightening their purses slightly. The ideal retention rate for the restaurant industry may differ from country to country so it would help compare this dataset’s retention & churn rate to the relevant country. However, we can surmise that since the majority of customers are students and have no reported income, it could mean affordability is a factor in the downward trends.

With this data, we can then begin to build a case for two types of business strategies with this analysis as a base model to reflect on.

1) Acquisition Strategy:

By Identifying our Customers, and knowing who, what, when, where, and why, we can then estimate the ideal targeted marketing strategy to affect the majority customer base. In addition to the measurements shown here, the next step would be to develop the:
LTV - Lifetime Value
CAC - Customer Acquisition Cost

This would help derive the estimated amount of marketing investment needed to increase the customer base pool.

2) Retention Strategy:

We’d want to implement a strategy to prevent current customers from churning before it happens will help boost your restaurant’s revenue. Considering the majority type of consumers we have, we’d expect a high churn rate (student, no declared income). By reducing it we can expect higher revenue from retained loyal customers. With the combination of the restaurant and menu data sets, we can also engage in pricing strategy and how a customer responds to a restaurant’s updated pricing model when it is placed into effect. With affordability in mind, a strong consideration of menu food cost, retail pricing, and execution will play a role in sales.
